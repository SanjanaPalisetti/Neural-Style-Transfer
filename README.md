# Neural-Style-Transfer
This project was completed to solve the challenge question presented by Myelin Foundry at https://github.com/myelin-foundry/challenge#org9124e2a

Neural style transfer is a technique that uses two input images, namely the style image and the content image, to create a new image which incorporates the content of the content image 'painted' in the style of the style image.

The challenge required us to take the following two images, japanse_garden.jpg as the Content image and picasso_selfpotrait.jpg as the Style Image, and create a style-transfer output.

# Content Image
![Japanese Garden](/Images/japanese_garden.jpg)

# Style Image
![Picasso's Self Portrait](/images/picasso_selfportrait.jpg)

# Output Image
![Generated Output](/images/output_image.png)

# Neural-Style-Transfer
Neural style transfer is a technique that uses a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. Here, two input images are taken, namely, the style image and the content image, to create a new image which incorporates the content of the content image 'painted' in the style of the style image.

The challenge required us to take the following two images, japanse_garden.jpg as the Content image and picasso_selfpotrait.jpg as the Style Image, and create a style-transfer output.

# Content Image
![Japanese Garden](/Images/japanese_garden.jpg)

# Style Image
![Picasso's Self Portrait](/Images/picasso_selfportrait.jpg)

# Output Image
